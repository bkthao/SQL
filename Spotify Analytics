#For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
#Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
#Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#I then inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

#1. I determined who the TOP 10 artists were by popularity.
SELECT artist_name,
track_name,
popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

#2. I used SQL to determine which artist had the longest duration track.
SELECT artist_name,
MAX(duration_ms) AS duration
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#3. By using SQL I determined the average danceability by artist and track.
SELECT artist_name,
track_name,
AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;
