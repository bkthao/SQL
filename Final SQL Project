#On my final SQL project for Breaking Into Tech I worked on a dataset called Chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT firstname,
lastname,
customerid,
country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> "USA";

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = "Brazil";

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT c.firstname,
c.lastname,
i.invoiceid,
i.invoicedate,
i.billingcountry
FROM chinook.invoices AS i
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS c
ON i.customerid = c.customerid
WHERE i.billingcountry = "Brazil";

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT e.firstname, 
e.lastname,
i.invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees AS e
INNER JOIN chinook.customers AS c ON c.SupportRepId = e.employeeid
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices AS i ON i.customerid = c.customerid;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT e.lastname,
e.firstname,
c.firstname,
c.lastname,
c.country,
i.total
FROM chinook.employees AS e
JOIN chinook.customers AS c ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
JOIN chinook.invoices AS i ON i.customerid = c.customerid;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name,
i.invoicelineid
FROM chinook.tracks AS t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items AS i
ON i.trackid = t.trackid;

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name AS Track,
ar.name AS Artist,
i.invoicelineid
FROM chinook.invoice_items AS i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks AS t ON t.trackid = i.trackid
INNER JOIN chinook.albums AS a ON a.albumid = t.albumid
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists AS ar ON ar.artistid = a.artistid;

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.name AS Track_Name,
a.title AS Album_Title,
m.name AS Media_Type,
g.name AS Genre
FROM chinook.tracks AS t
INNER JOIN chinook.media_types AS m ON m.mediatypeid = t.mediatypeid
INNER JOIN chinook.genres AS g ON g.genreid = t.genreid
INNER JOIN chinook.albums AS a ON a.albumid = t.albumid;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.firstname,
e.lastname,
ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees AS e
INNER JOIN chinook.customers AS c ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices AS i ON i.customerid = c.customerid
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.firstname;

#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.firstname AS First_Name,
e.lastname AS Last_Name,
ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees AS e
INNER JOIN chinook.customers AS c ON c.supportrepid = e.employeeid
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices AS i ON i.customerid = c.customerid
WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
GROUP BY e.firstname
ORDER BY 'Total Sales' desc
LIMIT 1;
